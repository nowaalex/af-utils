Simple open-source tools that just work _(usually fast)_

-   [Virtual scroll](https://af-utils.vercel.app/virtual) for rendering
    only visible part of huge lists or grids _(currently available for React)_
-   [Scrollend polyfill](https://af-utils.vercel.app/scrollend-polyfill) for cross-browser scrollend event support
-   To be continued...

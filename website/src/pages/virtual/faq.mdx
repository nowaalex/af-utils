# Frequently asked questions

Something is not working as expected? Or just curious? Here is the list of hints that may be interesting.

## There are other virtual scroll libraries. Why this one?

Awesome libraries, which inspired me to create my own:

-   [tanstack virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/)
-   [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)
-   [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)
-   [react-cool-virtual](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-virtual)
-   [react-virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/)

Features I was missing there and implemented/improved here:

-   flexible <DocLink slug="virtual-core">core api</DocLink>,
    which exposes <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller.get-index">getIndex</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller.get-offset">
    getOffset
    </DocLink> methods;
-   built-in event emitter, supporting different <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-event">events</DocLink>;
-   scroll position persistence after [prepending items](/virtual/examples/react/list/prepend-items);
-   isolated rerendering with separate [subscriptions](/virtual/examples/react/list/extra-events);
-   support of both [react hook](/virtual/examples/react/hook/simple) and [react component](/virtual/examples/react/list/simple) api, which allows to
    combine advantages of both aproaches.

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they equal <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-runtime-params.estimated-item-size">estimatedItemSize</DocLink>. But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

## How many items virtual scroller can handle?

Maximum quantity library can handle is `2_147_483_647` (int32 max), but it is better not to use such huge values. <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-runtime-params.item-count">Read more</DocLink>

## Is Server-side rendering supported?

Yes, you can adjust quantity of server-rendered items. <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-initial-params.estimated-widget-size">Read more</DocLink>

## Why cursor and scrollbar become unaligned after manual scrolling?

<Image
    src={scrollbarMisalign}
    alt="scrollbar unaligned"
    class="border sm:float-left sm:mr-3"
    quality={60}
/>

Items are remeasured on the fly. If <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-runtime-params.estimated-item-size">estimated item size</DocLink>
is different from the real one, <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller.scroll-size">scrollSize</DocLink> would jump, which causes scrollbar
unalignment. No size discrepancies leads to no jumps, so <DocLink slug="virtual-core.virtual-scroller-runtime-params.estimated-item-size">estimated item size</DocLink>
must be as accurate as possible.

## Why do all items disappear after scrolling to bottom?

Most likely it is related to [this Firefox 122 issue](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/133349), which is already fixed in version 124.
If it happens in different browser &ndash; feel free to open new issue [here](https://github.com/nowaalex/af-utils/issues).
If it happens in Firefox 124 or newer &ndash; feel free to reopen [existing issue](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/133349).

# Scrollend polyfill bundle size impact

This package was carefully optimized to be as small as possible.

<SizeInfo
    items={[
        [
            sizes["@af-utils/scrollend-polyfill"]["./dist/index.js"],
            "@af-utils/scrollend-polyfill"
        ]
    ]}
/>

## Minifier configuration

During bundle size measurement `process.env.NODE_ENV` was set to `production`
to cut away some extra checks and verbose errors.

```ts
const MINIFIER_CONFIG = {
    compress: {
        global_defs: {
            "process.env.NODE_ENV": "production"
        }
    }
};
```

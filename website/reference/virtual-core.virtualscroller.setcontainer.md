# VirtualScroller.setContainer() method

Informs model about items container element. Usually not needed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setContainer(element: HTMLElement | null): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  element | HTMLElement \| null | container element |

**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

By default top/left offset between scroll container and first scrollable item is `0`<!-- -->. In this case just [VirtualScroller.setScroller()](./virtual-core.virtualscroller.setscroller.md) is needed. But extra element is needed when something "foreign" stands between scroll container and first scrollable item to measure distance between them. That extra element is represented as `ItemsContainer` on this schema:

```plaintext
<ScrollContainer>                |.|
     Some header                 |s|
     Another header              |c|
     <ItemsContainer>            |r|
        item 1                   [o]
        item 2                   [l]
        item 3                   [l]
        ...                      [b]
     </ItemsContainer>           |a|
     Some footer                 |r|
</ScrollContainer>               |.|
```
Must be called with `null` before killing the instance.

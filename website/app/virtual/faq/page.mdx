# Frequently asked questions

Something is not working as expected? Or just curious? Here is the list of hints that may be interesting.

## There are other virtual scroll libraries. Why this one?

Awesome libraries, which inspired me to create my own:

-   [tanstack virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/)
-   [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)
-   [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)
-   [react-cool-virtual](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-virtual)
-   [react-virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/)

Features I was missing there and implemented/improved here:

-   flexible [core api](/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscroller.md),
    which exposes <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "VirtualScroller.getIndex")}>getIndex</AutoLink> and
    {""}<AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "VirtualScroller.getOffset")}>getOffset</AutoLink> methods;
-   built-in event emitter, supporting different {""}<AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "VirtualScrollerEvent")}>events</AutoLink>;
-   scroll position persistence after [prepending items](/virtual/examples/react/list/prepend-items);
-   isolated rerendering with separate [subscriptions](/virtual/examples/react/list/extra-events);
-   support of both [react hook](/virtual/examples/react/hook/simple) and [react component](/virtual/examples/react/list/simple) api, which allows to
    combine advantages of both aproaches.

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they equal <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.estimateditemsize")}>estimatedItemSize</AutoLink>. But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

## How many items virtual scroller can handle?

Maximum quantity library can handle is `2_147_483_647` (int32 max), but it is better not to use such huge values. <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.itemcount")}>Read more</AutoLink>

## Is Server-side rendering supported?

Yes, you can adjust quantity of server-rendered items. <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerinitialparams.estimatedwidgetsize" )}>Read more</AutoLink>

## Why cursor and scrollbar become unaligned after manual scrolling?

<img
    src="/scrollbar_misalign.gif"
    alt="scrollbar unaligned"
    className="border sm:float-left sm:mr-3"
/>

Items are remeasured on the fly. If <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.estimateditemsize")}>estimated item size</AutoLink>
is different from the real one, <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "VirtualScroller.scrollSize")}>scrollSize</AutoLink> would jump, which causes scrollbar
unalignment. No size discrepancies leads to no jumps, so <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.estimateditemsize")}>estimated item size</AutoLink>
must be as accurate as possible.

<p className="clear-both" />

## Why do all items disappear after scrolling to bottom?

Most likely it is related to [this Firefox 122 issue](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/133349), which is already fixed in version 124.
If it happens in different browser &ndash; feel free to open new issue [here](https://github.com/nowaalex/af-utils/issues).
If it happens in Firefox 124 or newer &ndash; feel free to reopen [existing issue](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/133349).

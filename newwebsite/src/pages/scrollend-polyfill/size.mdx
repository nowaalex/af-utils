# Scrollend polyfill bundle size impact

This package was carefully optimized to be as small as possible.
In order to provide exact numbers it is shipped with `bundlesize.index.js` file.
Contents of this file is shown in this table in human-readable format.

<SizeInfo items={[[coreSizes, "@af-utils/scrollend-polyfill"]]} />

## Terser configuration

During bundle size measurement `process.env.NODE_ENV` was set to `production`
to cut away some extra checks and verbose errors.

```tsx
const TERSER_OPTS = {
    compress: {
        global_defs: {
            "process.env.NODE_ENV": "production"
        }
    }
};
```

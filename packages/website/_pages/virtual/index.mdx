# Getting started

When you need to render a list, table or grid with a lot of rows or columns, you may face performance problems.
A lot of DOM nodes must be created, but only a few of them are visible.

One way to optimize this is called **virtual scroll**.
Based on scroll position and size of each item we can calculate the range to show.
Only visible elements are rendered with this approach.

<IndexExample />

Components ([List](/virtual/list), [Table](/virtual/table)) are available for basic use cases.
If you want maximum flexibility â€” [headless](/virtual/headless) API is for you.
Variable item sizes with <span className="whitespace-nowrap">on-the-fly</span> remeasurement are also supported.

# Supported adapters

Library core, housing all dimensions/calculations, is written in vanilla js, so it can be reused.

-   React
-   ~Vue~ (coming)
-   ~Angular~ (coming)
-   ~Svelte~ (coming)

# Supported browsers

```javascript
// taken from package.json

"browserslist": [
    ">0.6%",
    "not op_mini all"
]
```

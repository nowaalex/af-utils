import docHref from "utils/docHref";
import AutoLink from "components/AutoLink";

Virtualized dynamic-sized grids are supported,
just call <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-react", "useVirtual")}>useVirtual</AutoLink> two times for rows and columns.
**Important limitation:** masonry mode is not supported, so height of rows is taken from first rendered column and width of columns
is taken from first rendered row.

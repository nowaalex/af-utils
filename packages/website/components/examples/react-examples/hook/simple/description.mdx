import docHref from "utils/docHref";
import AutoLink from "components/AutoLink";

In simple cases like here [List component](../list/simple) is preferable. You will just end up writing less code.
But if you need [custom render](./custom-render), [window scroll](./window-scroll) or something similar - this example would be a nice starting
point. <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-react", "useVirtual")}>useVirtual hook</AutoLink> reference link is here to save your time.

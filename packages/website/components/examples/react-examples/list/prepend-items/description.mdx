import docHref from "utils/docHref";
import AutoLink from "components/AutoLink";

Visible elements range must be persisted after new ones are prepended?
Virtual scroll model exposes <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "VirtualScroller.visibleFrom")}>visibleFrom</AutoLink>,
which allows to get the position of the first visible item.

This example also shows <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-react", "useVirtualModel")}>useVirtualModel</AutoLink> opportuninies.
Classical approach would require `useState` to store items and `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` to scroll when they are updated.
If your data flow is very specific or you like to sacrifice readability for the sake of performance - go ahead.

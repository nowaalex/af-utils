import docHref from "utils/docHref";
import AutoLink from "components/AutoLink";

Virtual scroll model can emit <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core","VirtualScrollerEvent")}>events</AutoLink>, which is very convenient for loading something on demand.
Here new posts are loaded when list is scrolled till the end, but this behavior can be easily customized.

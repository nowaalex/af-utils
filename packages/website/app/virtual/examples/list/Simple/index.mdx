Virtual scroll can be used to render huge lists without performance problems.
All dimensions are calculated automatically.
Just provide [`itemCount`](/virtual/headless#itemcount-integer) and notify model about new elements with the help of [`el`](/virtual/headless#el-functionindex-integer-element-element--void).

Visible elements range must be persisted after new ones are prepended?
Virtual scroll model exposes [`visibleFrom`](/virtual/headless#visiblefrom-getter--double),
which allows to get the position of the first visible item.

This example also shows [`useVirtualModel`](/virtual/headless/#usevirtualmodel) opportuninies.
Classical approach would require `useState` to store items and `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` to scroll when they are updated.
If your data flow is very specific or you like to sacrifice readability for the sake of performance - go ahead.

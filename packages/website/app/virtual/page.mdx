# Getting started

When you need to render a list or grid with a lot of rows or columns, you may face performance problems.
A lot of DOM nodes must be created, but only a few of them are visible.

One way to optimize this is called **virtual scroll**.
Based on scroll position and size of each item we can calculate the range to show.
Only visible elements are rendered with this approach.

<IndexExample />

Variable item sizes with <span className="whitespace-nowrap">on-the-fly</span> remeasurement are also supported.

# Supported adapters

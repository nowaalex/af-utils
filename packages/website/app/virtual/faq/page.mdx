# Frequently asked questions

Something is not working as expected? Here is the list of hints that may help.

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they equal [estimatedItemSize](/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscrollerruntimeparams.estimateditemsize.md). But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

## How many items virtual scroller can handle?

Maximum quantity library can handle is `2_147_483_647` (int32 max), but it is better not to use such huge values. [Read more](/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscrollerruntimeparams.itemcount.md)

## Is Server-side rendering supported?

Yes, you can adjust quantity of server-rendered items. [Read more](/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscrollerinitialparams.estimatedwidgetsize.md)

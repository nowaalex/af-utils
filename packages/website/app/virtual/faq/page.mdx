# Frequently asked questions

Something is not working as expected? Here is the list of hints that may help.

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they equal <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.estimateditemsize")}>estimatedItemSize</AutoLink>. But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

## How many items virtual scroller can handle?

Maximum quantity library can handle is `2_147_483_647` (int32 max), but it is better not to use such huge values. <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerruntimeparams.itemcount")}>Read more</AutoLink>

## Is Server-side rendering supported?

Yes, you can adjust quantity of server-rendered items. <AutoLink href={docHref("virtual-core", "virtualscrollerinitialparams.estimatedwidgetsize" )}>Read more</AutoLink>

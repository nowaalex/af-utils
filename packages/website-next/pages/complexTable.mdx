## Complex table (unstable)

This component supports summary/filtering/grouping/sorting.

* It is not yet ready to be published as stable, because API is changed frequently
* It is not fully documented
* It depends on react-dnd, mobx and mobx-react-lite

export default ({ children }) => <MdxWrapper>{children}</MdxWrapper>;

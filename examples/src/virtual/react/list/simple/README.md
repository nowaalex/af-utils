Virtual scroll can be used to render huge lists without performance problems.
All dimensions are calculated automatically.
Just provide [itemCount](https://af-utils.com/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscrollerruntimeparams)
and notify model about new elements with the help of [VirtualScroller.attachitem](https://af-utils.com/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscroller.attachitem).

In simple cases like here [List component](https://af-utils.com/virtual/examples/react/list/simple) is preferable. You will just end up writing less code.
But if you need [custom render](https://af-utils.com/virtual/examples/react/hook/custom-render),
[window scroll](https://af-utils.com/virtual/examples/react/hook/window-scroll) or something similar - this example would be a nice starting
point. [useVirtual hook](https://af-utils.com/virtual/reference/virtual-react.usevirtual.md) reference link is here to save your time.

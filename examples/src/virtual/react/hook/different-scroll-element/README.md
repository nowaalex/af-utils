You can use [VirtualScroller.setContainer](https://af-utils.com/virtual/reference/virtual-core.virtualscroller.setcontainer) in case something is rendered before primary virtual scroller items. It may be also useful in [window scroll](https://af-utils.com/virtual/examples/react/hook/window-scroll) scenario.

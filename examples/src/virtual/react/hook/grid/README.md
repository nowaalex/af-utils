Virtualized dynamic-sized grids are supported,
just call [useVirtual](https://af-utils.com/virtual/reference/virtual-react.usevirtual) two times for rows and columns.
**Important limitation:** masonry mode is not supported, so height of rows is taken from first rendered column and width of columns
is taken from first rendered row.
